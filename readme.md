#About
This project was started as an front-end exercise in developing a webpage with a few interactive components from an existing set of design files (see folder).

#Setup
1. Install Sass using Brew (see: [Installing Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install))
2. Install Neat using NPM. Yes, Neat is now deprecated, but it works for older browsers that may not yet support CSS Grid. (see: [Neat on Github](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat))
